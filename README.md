# ReD-Lat Genetics Toolbox

This repository containing the scripts for the first publication of ReD-Lat Genetic data analysis.
The scripts and pipelines are organizaed according to the workflow presented in the methods of our manuscript *Genetic Contributions to Alzheimer's Disease and Frontotemporal Dementia in Admixed Latin American Populations* [link].



**Genomic analyses**
	
1. Genomic data quality control 

    a. Quality control of VCF files
    
    b. Relatedness
    
    c. [Combining Datasets](/combine_genome_array.sh): Script designed to combine the arrays and WGS data
    
    d. [Check Concordance](/Check-Concordance): A set of scripts developed to ensure concordance between data from imputed arrays and whole-genome sequencing (WGS) for the same individual.

2. Population Stratification

    a. Principal Component analysis
    
    b. Global Ancestry

    c. [Local Ancestry](/phasing_ancestry.sh)
